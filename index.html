<body>
   <p> my mum once told me,you can be anything you think you can be,
    you can also at the same time not be anything you think you can't be.
the hidden power of immagination and thought is so powerful that it dosen't 
select people neither does it consider age or the background of the individual involved.</p>
<blockquote>that above is not the main beautiful thing about our minds,one of the most amaizing
    things about this is that consistent immagination works even faster.what i'm saying is ,
    if you can only imagine it,
    impossiblity is nothing.
